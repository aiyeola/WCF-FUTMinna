# Biodata app for WCF-FUTMinna

This app is inspired from looking for an alternative solution to collecting biodata of students without use of services like googleDocs

## Purpose

To help the student administrators of the Winners' Campus Fellowship FUTMinna collect the database of students in a more savvy way without use of ready-made form services.

As a practice for building enterprise grade project.

## Motivation

A desire to change the world by creating creative solutions to problems

> #### Caution

This project is a progressive application of the knowledge gotten over time. As I learn, I add. :smile:
